<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Rushikesh Kulkarni, a 24-year-old with a passion for web development
and coding. I embarked on my journey with a background in Pharmacy, holding a bachelor's<br /> 
degree in the field. However, my curiosity and enthusiasm for technology led me to explore 
the exciting world of web development.
</p>
<p>I find immense joy in crafting digital experiences through coding. 
  My determination to become a proficient web developer is fueled by my eagerness to <br />
  learn and innovate. With every line of code I write, I'm one step closer to turning my 
  aspirations into reality.
</p>
<p>Beyond the realm of coding, I have a diverse range of interests that keep me engaged
   and inspired. Dance and singing are two of my creative outlets, allowing me to express<br /> 
   myself in unique ways. The rhythm and melodies offer a balance to the structured world 
   of coding, enabling me to tap into a different kind of creativity.
